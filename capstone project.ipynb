    "Perth is an up and coming city so the number of vegetarian restaurants are still limited comapared to other capital cities in Australia. Given vegetarians are a minority compared to meat eaters, our goal would be open a restaurant in an area that is popular with diners but currently lacking in vegetarian options. \n",
